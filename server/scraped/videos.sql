To do this we?re going to import a labeled dataset, called EMNIST, we?ll use a pre-written library called SKLearn to build the network, we?ll train and tweak our code until it?s accurate (enough), and then we?ll use our newly trained network to convert John Green Bot?s handwritten pages.<br /><br />We created this project in a way that you don?t have to install anything on your computer, the only thing you?ll need to get started is a Google account and a sense of adventure! To run the Colaboratory file (link at the top) you?ll have to click ?open in playground? at the top of the page OR open the File Menu and click ?Save a Copy to Drive.? From there you can change, tweak, and edit the code as you wish. We also left text around and within the code to help you along the way.

        'Robots aren?t like humans who can do a lot of different things. They?re designed for very specific tasks like vacuuming our homes, assembling cars in a factory, or exploring the surface of other planets. So even though it may be a while before we have a general household robot that can do it all, robots are still really important because they can do some things incredibly well even better than humans. So today, we&#x27;re going to take a look at the role of AI in overcoming three key challenges in the field of robotics: localization, planning, and manipulation.  <br /><br />Crash Course is produced in association with PBS Digital Studios:<br />https://www.youtube.com/pbsdigitalstudios<br /><br />Crash Course is on Patreon!

These plants have found tremendous success and their secret is also their defining trait: conductive tissues that can take food and water from one part of a plant to another part. Though it sounds simple, the ability to move nutrients and water from one part of an organism to another was an evolutionary breakthrough for vascular plants, allowing them to grow exponentially larger, store food for lean times, and develop features that allowed them to spread farther and faster. Plants dominated the earth long before animals even showed up, and even today hold the world records for the largest, most massive, and oldest organisms on the planet.<br /><br />Table of Contents<br />1) 3 Tissue Types 02:37<br />2) Primary Growth 03:04<br />3) Secondary Growth 03:28<br />4) Dermal Tissue 04:47<br />a) Epidermis 04:54<br />5) Parenchyma Cells 05:39<br />6) Vascular Tissue 05:58<br />7) Xylem 05:58<br />8) Collenchyma 07:10<br />9) Sclerenchyma 07:35<br />10) Ground Tissue 08:25<br />a) Mesophyll 08:17<br />b) Photosynthesis 08:47<br />11) Phloem 09:54<br /><br />References<br />http://www.uic.edu/classes/bios/bios100/lecturesf04am/lect17.htm<br />http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700071982/Central-Utahs-Pando-worlds-largest-living-thing-is-threatened-scientists-say.html?pg=all<br />http://www.popsci.com/science/article/2012-02/200000-year-old-patch-seagrass-worlds-oldest-living-organism<br /><br />Crash Course is on Patreon!

        'Hank gets into the dirty details about vascular plant reproduction: they use the basic alternation of generations developed by nonvascular plants 470 million years ago, but they&#x27;ve tricked it out so that it works a whole lot different compared to the way it did back in the Ordovician swamps where it got its start.

Unfortunately, the ideal gas law (like our culture) has unrealistic expectations when it comes to size and attraction: it assumes that particles do not have size at all and that they never attract each other.  So the ideal gas &quot;law&quot; often becomes little more than the ideal gas estimate when it comes to what gases do naturally.

As with most things in chemistry (and also in life), how a gas moves is more complex than it seems at first. In this episode, Hank describes what it means when we talk about the velocity of a gas - to understand gas velocity, we have to know what factors affect it, and how. Hank also teaches you about effusion, diffusion, and concentration gradients, before showing off a cool experiment that physically demonstrates the things you have just learned.

That&#x27;s not the simplest question to answer, but today Hank will answer it (kinda), by teaching us about a nifty little thing called enthalpy.<br /><br />If you are paying attention to this episode you&#x27;ll learn what the state function is, and how it varies from a path-dependent function; why enthalpy change is different from heat; that bonds are energy and to form and break them they release and absorb heat to and from their environment. You&#x27;ll get the quickest introduction to calorimetry ever (more on that in upcoming episodes) and learn the power of Hess&#x27;s Law and how to use Germain Hess&#x27;s concept of the standard enthalpy of formation to calculate exactly how much heat is produced by any chemical reaction. <br /><br />Pssst... we made flashcards to help you review the content in this episode!

        'Life is chaos and the universe tends toward disorder. But why? If you think about it, there are only a few ways for things to be arranged in an organized manner, but there are nearly infinite other ways for those same things to be arranged. Simple rules of probability dictate that it&#x27;s much more likely for stuff to be in one of the many disorganized states than in one of the few organized states. This tendency is so unavoidable that it&#x27;s known as the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics. Obviously, disorder is a pretty big deal in the universe and that makes it a pretty big deal in chemistry - it&#x27;s such a big deal that scientists have a special name for it: entropy. In chemistry, entropy is the measure of molecular randomness or disorder.

        'Atoms are a lot like us - we call their relationships &quot;bonds,&quot; and there are many different types. Each kind of atomic relationship requires a different type of energy, but they all do best when they settle into the lowest stress situation possible. The nature of the bond between atoms is related to the distance between them and, like people, it also depends on how positive or negative they are. Unlike human relationships, we can analyze exactly what makes chemical relationships work, and that&#x27;s what this episode is all about. <br /><br />If you are paying attention, you will learn that chemical bonds form in order to minimize the energy difference between two atoms or ions; that those chemical bonds may be covalent if atoms share electrons, and that covalent bonds can share those electrons evenly or unevenly; that bonds can also be ionic if the electrons are transferred instead of shared: and how to calculate the energy transferred in an ionic bond using Coulomb&#x27;s Law. <br /><br />Pssst... we made flashcards to help you review the content in this episode!

In this edition of Crash Course Chemistry, Hank comes out for Team Polar and describes why these molecules are so interesting to him. <br /><br />You&#x27;ll learn that molecules need to have both charge asymmetry and geometric asymmetry to be polar, and that charge asymmetry is caused by a difference in electronegativities.

So today, we?re going to take a look at computing?s origins, because even though our digital computers are relatively new, the need for computation is not. Since the start of civilization itself, humans have had an increasing need for special devices to help manage laborious tasks, and as the scale of society continued to grow, these computational devices began to play a crucial role in amplifying our mental abilities. From the abacus and astrolabe to the difference engine and tabulating machine, we?ve come a long way to satisfying this increasing need, and in the process completely transformed commerce, government, and daily life. <br /><br />Produced in collaboration with PBS Digital Studios: http://youtube.com/pbsdigitalstudios<br /><br />Want to know more about Carrie Anne?<br />https://about.me/carrieannephilbin<br /><br />Want more Crash Course in person?

We?re going to focus on three fundamental operations - NOT, AND, and OR - and show how they were created in a series of really useful circuits. And its these simple electrical circuits that lay the groundwork for our much more complex machines. <br /><br />*CORRECTION* AT 1:27 the graph says &quot;Quinary System&quot; but then the graph shows 10 possible states - which is actually decimal.

So today we&#x27;re going to use the binary and logic gates we learned in previous episodes to build one from scratch, and then we&#x27;ll use our newly minted ALU when we construct the heart of a computer, the CPU, in episode 7. <br /><br />*CORRECTION*<br /><br />We got our wires crossed with the Intel 4004, which we discuss later. The 74181 was introduced by Texas Instruments in 1970 but appeared in technical manuals around 1969. The design of the 74181, like most of the 74xx/74xxx series, was an open design which was manufactured by many other companies - Fairchild was one such manufacturer. They produced a chip, the Fairchild 9341, which was pin-for-pin compatible with the 74181.<br /><br />Fairchild was the first to prototype an ALU, building the Fairchild 4711 in 1968 - a one-off device not optimized for scale manufacturing. In 1969, Signetics came out with the 8260, which they marketed in a very limited sense (it was attached, AFAICT, to one particular computer, the Data General SUPERNOVA). TI follows afterwards (March 1970) with the 74181, coupled with the 9341 from Fairchild. The 74181 became the standard number for this part, and was available from many manufacturers (back in those days, chip makers cross-licensed designs all over the place in order to provide assurance that their part could be sourced from multiple manufacturers).<br /><br />Produced in collaboration with PBS Digital Studios: http://youtube.com/pbsdigitalstudios<br /><br />The Latest from PBS Digital Studios: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...<br /><br />We?ve got merch!<br />https://store.dftba.com/collections/crashcourse<br /><br />Want to know more about Carrie Anne?<br />https://about.me/carrieannephilbin<br /><br />Want to find Crash Course elsewhere on the internet?<br />Facebook - http://www.facebook.com/YouTubeCrashC...<br />Twitter - http://www.twitter.com/TheCrashCourse<br />Tumblr - http://thecrashcourse.tumblr.com <br />Support Crash Course on Patreon: http://patreon.com/crashcourse<br />CC Kids: http://www.youtube.com/crashcoursekids<br /><br />Want to find Crash Course elsewhere on the internet?<br />Facebook - http://www.facebook.com/YouTubeCrashCourse<br />Twitter - http://www.twitter.com/TheCrashCourse<br />Tumblr - http://thecrashcourse.tumblr.com <br />Support Crash Course on Patreon: http://patreon.com/crashcourse<br /><br />CC Kids: http://www.youtube.com/crashcoursekids',

RAM is the working memory of a computer. It holds the information that is being executed by the computer and as such is a crucial component for a computer to operate.

For much of this series we?ve been talking about machine code, or the 1?s and 0?s our computers read to perform operations, but giving our computers instructions in 1?s and 0?s is incredibly inefficient, and a ?higher-level? language was needed. This led to the development of assembly code and assemblers that allow us to use operands and mnemonics to more easily write programs, but assembly language is still tied to underlying hardware. So by 1952 Navy officer Grace Hopper had helped created the first high-level programming language A-0 and compiler to translate that code to our machines. This would eventually lead to IBM?s Fortran and then a golden age of computing languages over the coming decades. Most importantly, these new languages utilized new abstractions to make programming easier and more powerful giving more and more people the ability to create new and amazing things. <br /><br /><br />Produced in collaboration with PBS Digital Studios: http://youtube.com/pbsdigitalstudios<br /><br />Want to know more about Carrie Anne?<br />https://about.me/carrieannephilbin<br /><br />The Latest from PBS Digital Studios: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1mtdjDVOoOqJzeaJAV15Tq0tZ1vKj7ZV<br /><br />Want to find Crash Course elsewhere on the internet?<br />Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/YouTubeCrash...<br />Twitter - http://www.twitter.com/TheCrashCourse<br />Tumblr - http://thecrashcourse.tumblr.com <br />Support Crash Course on Patreon: http://patreon.com/crashcourse<br /><br />CC Kids: http://www.youtube.com/crashcoursekids',

So last episode we talked about some basic file formats, but what we didn?t talk about is compression. Often files are way too large to be easily stored on hard drives or transferred over the Internet - the solution, unsurprisingly, is to make them smaller. Today, we?re going to talk about lossless compression, which will give you the exact same thing when reassembled, as well as lossy compression, which uses the limitations of human perception to remove less important data. From listening to music and sharing photos, to talking on the phone and even streaming this video right now the ways we use the Internet and our computing devices just wouldn?t be possible without the help of compression. <br /><br />Pre-order our limited edition Crash Course: Computer Science Floppy Disk Coasters here! <br />https://store.dftba.com/products/computer-science-coasters<br /><br />Produced in collaboration with PBS Digital Studios: http://youtube.com/pbsdigitalstudios <br /><br />Want to know more about Carrie Anne?<br />https://about.me/carrieannephilbin<br /><br />The Latest from PBS Digital Studios: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1mtdjDVOoOqJzeaJAV15Tq0tZ1vKj7ZV<br /><br />Want to find Crash Course elsewhere on the internet?<br />Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/YouTubeCrash...<br />Twitter - http://www.twitter.com/TheCrashCourse<br />Tumblr - http://thecrashcourse.tumblr.com <br />Support Crash Course on Patreon: http://patreon.com/crashcourse<br />CC Kids: http://www.youtube.com/crashcoursekids',

So we ended last episode with the proliferation of command line (or text) interfaces, which sometimes used screens, but typically electronic typewriters or teletypes onto paper. But by the early 1960s a number of technologies were introduced to make screens much more useful from cathode ray tubes and graphics cards to ASCII art and light pens. This era would mark a turning point in computing - computers were no longer just number crunching machines, but potential assistants interactively augmenting human tasks.

        'Today we&#x27;re going to talk about the birth of personal computing. Up until the early 1970s components were just too expensive, or underpowered, for making a useful computer for an individual,  but this would begin to change with the introduction of the Altair 8800 in 1975. In the years that follow, we&#x27;ll see the founding of Microsoft and Apple and the creation of the 1977 Trinity: The Apple II, Tandy TRS-80, and Commodore PET 2001. These new consumer oriented computers would become a huge hit, but arguably the biggest success of the era came with the release of the IBM PC in 1981. IBM completely changed the industry as its &quot;IBM compatible&quot; open architecture consolidated most of the industry except for, notably, Apple. Apple chose a closed architecture forming the basis of the Mac Vs PC debate that rages today. But in 1984, when Apple was losing marketshare fast it looked for a way to offer a new user experience like none other - which we&#x27;ll discuss next week. <br /><br />Pre-order our limited edition Crash Course: Computer Science Floppy Disk Coasters here! <br />https://store.dftba.com/products/computer-science-coasters<br /><br />Produced in collaboration with PBS Digital Studios: http://youtube.com/pbsdigitalstudios <br /><br />Want to know more about Carrie Anne?<br />https://about.me/carrieannephilbin<br /><br />The Latest from PBS Digital Studios: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1mtdjDVOoOqJzeaJAV15Tq0tZ1vKj7ZV<br /><br />Want to find Crash Course elsewhere on the internet?<br />Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/YouTubeCrash...<br />Twitter - http://www.twitter.com/TheCrashCourse<br />Tumblr - http://thecrashcourse.tumblr.com <br />Support Crash Course on Patreon: http://patreon.com/crashcourse<br />CC Kids: http://www.youtube.com/crashcoursekids',

This all changed with the introduction of the Macintosh by Apple in 1984. It was the first mainstream computer to use a GUI, standing on the shoulder of nearly two decades of innovation including work from the father of the GUI himself, Douglas Englebart, and some amazing breakthroughs at Xerox Parc. <br /><br /><br />Pre-order our limited edition Crash Course: Computer Science Floppy Disk Coasters here! <br />https://store.dftba.com/products/computer-science-coasters<br /><br />Produced in collaboration with PBS Digital Studios: http://youtube.com/pbsdigitalstudios <br /><br />Want to know more about Carrie Anne?<br />https://about.me/carrieannephilbin<br /><br />The Latest from PBS Digital Studios: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1mtdjDVOoOqJzeaJAV15Tq0tZ1vKj7ZV<br /><br />Want to find Crash Course elsewhere on the internet?<br />Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/YouTubeCrash...<br />Twitter - http://www.twitter.com/TheCrashCourse<br />Tumblr - http://thecrashcourse.tumblr.com <br />Support Crash Course on Patreon: http://patreon.com/crashcourse<br />CC Kids: http://www.youtube.com/crashcoursekids',

        'Today we?re going to talk about how to keep information secret, and this isn?t a new goal. From as early as Julius Caesar?s Caesar cipher to Mary, Queen of Scots, encrypted messages to kill Queen Elizabeth in 1587, theres has long been a need to encrypt and decrypt private correspondence. This proved especially critical during World War II as Allan Turing and his team at Bletchley Park attempted to decrypt messages from Nazi Enigma machines, and this need has only grown as more and more information sensitive tasks are completed on our computers. So today, we?re going to walk you through some common encryption techniques such as the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange, and RSA which are employed to keep your information safe, private, and secure. <br /><br />Note: In October of 2017, researchers released a viable hack against WPA2, known as KRACK Attack, which uses AES to ensure secure communication between computers and network routers. The problem isn&#x27;t with AES, which is provably secure, but with the communication protocol between router and computer.  In order to set up secure communication, the computer and router have to agree through what&#x27;s called a &quot;handshake&quot;.  If this handshake is interrupted in just the right way, an attacker can cause the handshake to fault to an insecure state and reveal critical information which makes the connection insecure.  As is often the case with these situations, the problem is with an implementation, not the secure algorithm itself.

And even though our virtual assistants like Siri, Alexa, Google Home, Bixby, and Cortana have come a long way from the first speech processing and synthesis models, there is still much room for improvement. <br /><br />Produced in collaboration with PBS Digital Studios: http://youtube.com/pbsdigitalstudios <br /><br />Want to know more about Carrie Anne?<br />https://about.me/carrieannephilbin<br /><br />The Latest from PBS Digital Studios: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1mtdjDVOoOqJzeaJAV15Tq0tZ1vKj7ZV<br /><br />Want to find Crash Course elsewhere on the internet?<br />Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/YouTubeCrash...<br />Twitter - http://www.twitter.com/TheCrashCourse<br />Tumblr - http://thecrashcourse.tumblr.com <br />Support Crash Course on Patreon: http://patreon.com/crashcourse<br />CC Kids: http://www.youtube.com/crashcoursekids',

        'Today we&#x27;re going to talk about robots! Robots are often thought as a technology of the future, but they&#x27;re already here by the millions in the workplace, our homes, and pretty soon on the roads. We&#x27;ll discuss the origins of robotics to its proliferation, and even look at some common control designs that were implemented to make them more useful in the workplace. Robots are often thought of as a menace or danger to society, and although there definitely is the propensity for malicious uses,  robots also have the potential to drastically improve the world. <br /><br />Produced in collaboration with PBS Digital Studios: http://youtube.com/pbsdigitalstudios <br /><br />Want to know more about Carrie Anne?<br />https://about.me/carrieannephilbin<br /><br />The Latest from PBS Digital Studios: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1mtdjDVOoOqJzeaJAV15Tq0tZ1vKj7ZV<br /><br />Want to find Crash Course elsewhere on the internet?<br />Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/YouTubeCrash...<br />Twitter - http://www.twitter.com/TheCrashCourse<br />Tumblr - http://thecrashcourse.tumblr.com <br />Support Crash Course on Patreon: http://patreon.com/crashcourse<br />CC Kids: http://www.youtube.com/crashcoursekids',

        'We?ve spent most of this series talking about computers. Which makes sense - this is Crash Course COMPUTER SCIENCE after all. But at their core computers are tools employed by humans and humans are pretty complicated. So today, we?re going to discuss some psychological considerations in building computers like how to make them easier for humans to use, the uncanny valley problem when humanoid robots gets more and more humanlike, and strategies to make our devices work better with us by incorporating our emotions and even altering our gaze. Oh, and we&#x27;ll talk about Carrie Anne&#x27;s all time favorite user interface design principle - knurling. <br /><br />Produced in collaboration with PBS Digital Studios: http://youtube.com/pbsdigitalstudios <br /><br />Want to know more about Carrie Anne?<br />https://about.me/carrieannephilbin<br /><br />The Latest from PBS Digital Studios: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1mtdjDVOoOqJzeaJAV15Tq0tZ1vKj7ZV<br /><br />Want to find Crash Course elsewhere on the internet?<br />Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/YouTubeCrash...<br />Twitter - http://www.twitter.com/TheCrashCourse<br />Tumblr - http://thecrashcourse.tumblr.com <br />Support Crash Course on Patreon: http://patreon.com/crashcourse<br />CC Kids: http://www.youtube.com/crashcoursekids',

        'In our SERIES FINALE of Crash Course Computer Science we take a look towards the future! In the past 70 years electronic computing has fundamentally changed how we live our lives, and we believe it?s just getting started. From ubiquitous computing, artificial intelligence, and self-driving cars to brain computer interfaces, wearable computers, and maybe even the singularity there is so much amazing potential on the horizon. Of course there is also room for peril with the rise of artificial intelligence and more immediate displacement of much of the workforce through automation. It?s tough to predict how it will all shake out, but it?s our hope that this series has inspired you to take part in shaping that future. Thank you so much for watching.      <br /><br />Produced in collaboration with PBS Digital Studios: http://youtube.com/pbsdigitalstudios <br /><br />Want to know more about Carrie Anne?<br />https://about.me/carrieannephilbin<br /><br />The Latest from PBS Digital Studios: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1mtdjDVOoOqJzeaJAV15Tq0tZ1vKj7ZV<br /><br />Want to find Crash Course elsewhere on the internet?<br />Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/YouTubeCrash...<br />Twitter - http://www.twitter.com/TheCrashCourse<br />Tumblr - http://thecrashcourse.tumblr.com <br />Support Crash Course on Patreon: http://patreon.com/crashcourse<br />CC Kids: http://www.youtube.com/crashcoursekids',

In the mid-1800s, Scottish physicist James Maxwell thought something interesting was going on there, too. So he decided to assemble a set of equations that held true for all electromagnetic interactions. In this episode of Crash Course Physics, Shini talks to us about Maxwell&#x27;s Equations and how important they are to our understanding of Physics. <br /><br />--<br /><br />Produced in collaboration with PBS Digital Studios: http://youtube.com/pbsdigitalstudios<br /><br />--<br /><br />Want to find Crash Course elsewhere on the internet?<br />Facebook - http://www.facebook.com/YouTubeCrashC...<br />Twitter - http://www.twitter.com/TheCrashCourse<br />Tumblr - http://thecrashcourse.tumblr.com <br />Support CrashCourse on Patreon: http://www.patreon.com/crashcourse<br /><br />CC Kids: http://www.youtube.com/crashcoursekids',

        'LIGHT! Let&#x27;s talk about it today. Sunlight, moonlight, torchlight, and flashlight. They all come from different places, but they?re the very same thing: light! It?s what makes it possible for us to see the world around us, so it?s worth a close, hard look. For instance, how does light travel? When you flip that switch in the bathroom to brush your teeth, how does light move from the light bulb, to the mirror, and into your eyes?<br /><br />--<br /><br />Produced in collaboration with PBS Digital Studios: http://youtube.com/pbsdigitalstudios<br /><br />--<br /><br />Want to find Crash Course elsewhere on the internet?<br />Facebook - http://www.facebook.com/YouTubeCrashC...<br />Twitter - http://www.twitter.com/TheCrashCourse<br />Tumblr - http://thecrashcourse.tumblr.com <br />Support CrashCourse on Patreon: http://www.patreon.com/crashcourse<br /><br />CC Kids: http://www.youtube.com/crashcoursekids',

Statistics help us better understand the world and make decisions from what you&#x27;ll wear tomorrow to government policy. But in the wrong hands, statistics can be used to misinform. So we&#x27;re going to try to do two things in this series. Help show you the usefulness of statistics, but also help you become a more informed consumer of statistics. From probabilities, paradoxes, and p-values there&#x27;s a lot to cover in this series, and there will be some math, but we promise only when it&#x27;s most important. But first, we should talk about what statistics actually are, and what we can do with them.

So instead of asking every single person about student loan debt for instance we take a sample of the population, and then use the shape of our samples to make inferences about the true underlying distribution our data. It turns out we can learn a lot about how something occurs, even if we don&#x27;t know the underlying process that causes it. Today, we?ll also introduce the normal (or bell) curve and talk about how we can learn some really useful things from a sample&#x27;s shape - like if an exam was particularly difficult, how often old faithful erupts, or if there are two types of runners that participate in marathons! <br /><br />Crash Course is on Patreon!

        'Today we?re going to talk about data relationships and what we can learn from them. We?ll focus on correlation, which is a measure of how two variables move together, and we?ll also introduce some useful statistical terms you?ve probably heard of like regression coefficient, correlation coefficient (r), and r^2. But first, we?ll need to introduce a useful way to represent bivariate continuous data - the scatter plot. The scatter plot has been called ?the most useful invention in the history of statistical graphics? but that doesn?t necessarily mean it can tell us everything. Just because two data sets move together doesn?t necessarily mean one CAUSES the other. This gives us one of the most important tenets of statistics: correlation does not imply causation. <br /><br />Crash Course is on Patreon!

        'Today we&#x27;re going to begin our three-part unit on p-values. In this episode we&#x27;ll talk about Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (or NHST) which is a framework for comparing two sets of information. In NHST we assume that there is no difference between the two things we are observing and and use our p-value as a predetermined cutoff for if something seems sufficiently rare or not to allow us to reject that these two observations are the same. This p-value tells us if something is statistically significant, but as you&#x27;ll see that doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean the information is significant or meaningful to you. <br /><br />Crash Course is on Patreon!
