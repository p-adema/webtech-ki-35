It is being called like that because it&#x27;s simpler, because marketing, because semantics loses to practicity, and a bunch of other stuff.<br /><br /><br />But the vast majority of what we really have working today is machine learning with a few very specific applications for artificial neural networks.<br /><br /><br />Intelligence is a very general, very broad concept in itself. But I&#x27;d argue that among traits that are often attributed to intelligence, the so called artificial intelligence hasn&#x27;t gotten even half of the easier ones for an automated system to get just yet.<br /><br /><br />Logic, learning to a point, planning to a point, problem solving for very specific problems. That&#x27;s about it. It leaves out creativity, critical reasoning, understanding, reasoning, emotional knowledge, and perhaps most important of all - self-awareness.<br /><br /><br />A huge part of the fears about AI stems from two distinct things about AI evolution. One is pretty clear and has to be addressed as soon as possible - the usage of AI by bad actors. So it&#x27;s not about AI as an evil thing, it&#x27;s about the power of the tool itself. Which is just the same fear of nuclear power. In the wrong hands, it could be employed to make peoples&#x27; lives miserable, if not outright end life altogether.<br />It&#x27;s easy enough to understand how. A dictatorship that wants to control it&#x27;s population could use all sorts of algorithms, neural networks, machine learning and so called AI related techniques to get the upper hand and give power and control to a central power. It is already being employed in this way. So we have to take action to stop it, lest we wanna conform to a life under oppressive control.<br />Likewise, AI could be employed to developed even more powerful weapons of mass destruction. Train an AI to run through millions of scenarios modifying a virus or tweaking a disease, there you go.<br /><br /><br />But there is another very distinct fear - about what happens when artificial intelligence algorithms becomes so sophisticated running in machines so powerful that they achieve something like self-awareness. This is the distant scenario fear and worry, also known as singularity. This is further into the future, but something that people are starting to worry right now. Some argue that we&#x27;d need something like general intelligence for something like that to happen, which seems almost unreachable right now. Some think we don&#x27;t need to go that far.<br /><br /><br />In any case, a topic worth discussing. Glad to see CrashCourse covering it.', FROM_UNIXTIME(1580601600), null, 11),

Oxygenated blood passes through these vessels---arteries--narrower arterioles and finally even narrower capillaries. However, even with many narrow capillaries, not every cell in the body can obtain the metabolic products it needs directly from the capillaries. Therefore, the final journey of these compounds is via a liquid solution which bathes the tissues-this is tissue fluid. Blood pressure increases as blood is squeezed into narrower and narrower vessels. Blood pressure in capillaries is so high that blood plasma is forced out under ultrafiltration from the capillaries-This plasma, along with dissolved molecules eg glucose, oxygen, amino acids etc. forms the tissue fluid. Cells absorb glucose and oxygen and release CO2 and waste products to the tissue fluid. This fluid must be returned to the circulatory system (eg back to the blood) to allow tissues to keep getting the substances they need. Most tissue fluid returns to the capillaries (as blood in capillary now has lower water potential than tissue fluid as blood plasma squeezed out+lots of undiluted proteins remain in blood-also loss of blood plasma has reduced blood pressure to lower than hydrostatic pressure of tissue fluid-so there is a pressure gradient too). However, not all tissue fluid can be returned via the capillaries. The rest returns via lymphatic system-Initially resembles capillaries but then merges into larger vessels and combines with vena cava just before entry to the heart to return to blood+remove waste products. Tissue fluid is moved along lymph by hydrostatic pressure gradient of tissue fluid (high at tissues, lower at vena cava end-so fluid moves down pressure gradient) and the contraction of muscles (the same as how blood moves through veins). Also, a system of valves ensure fluid only flows in 1 direction (again like veins). I hope this helps. It&#x27;s basically just another network of vessels that return excess blood plasma to the blood after being squeezed out of capillaries :) Sorry for rambling! ??', FROM_UNIXTIME(1454371200), 'htJ6nIPEGv7lw6aHm2klQlxGjTCEFCD6y8hABIopoaAdNJ0KAWmpQdiweonIZBJV', 2),

<br />
<br />Eukaryotic cells, with membrane ,organelles and nucleus containing DNA that calls the shots
<br />Animal, plants, fungi and protist
<br />Flexible and squishy membranes as oppose to plants, allowing the creation of cell, organs and tissue types
<br />
<br />Cell is like a city:
<br />
<br />On the surface:
<br />
<br />Microtubials: made of long protein fibers: Cillia (tiny arms like in lungs and throat pushing the mucus up) and Flagella (whip-like tail like in sperms), Protozoans, move with Microtubials instead of muscle tissue
<br />Membrane: Selective permeability: monitoring coming in and out like boarders
<br />
<br />Inside:
<br />
<br />Cytoplasm: water+nutrients
<br />Cytoskeleton: scaffolding made of protein strands, Centrosomes: infrastructures
<br />Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER): network of membranes like a highway system
<br />
<br />The smoother parts of ER are like factories:
<br />containing enzymes (proteins) producing lipids,
<br />detoxifying substances by adding carboxyl to make them soluble in water,
<br />storing ions like Sodium used for energy
<br />
<br />The rougher parts of ER have Ribosomes attached to them:
<br />Synthesis and packaging of proteins
<br />
<br />Ribosomes: float freely, assemble amino acids into Polypeptides pushing the protein chain into ER where it&#x27;s bitten off and sent to Golgi Aparatus
<br />
<br />Golgi: made of membranous layers: the post office for packaging proteins, cutting them into hormones, combining them with Carbs to make molecules
<br />Vessicles: the packages with Phospholipid walls
<br />
<br />Lysosome: waste treatment and recycling, sacks containing enzymes breaking down cell waste into building material
<br />
<br />Mitochondria: the power plant where respiration takes place, fuels converted to Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) which is the currency
<br />They were separate bacteria that animal cells absorbed and kept, and they still act as their own organisms with their own DNA, they exist in the egg and doesn&#x27;t mix with sperms DNA during fertilization
<br />
<br />Nucleus:
<br />
<br />The leader
<br />Contains DNA and has all the information and instructions
<br />
<br />Has a double membrane
<br />Nucleoplasm (is like Cytoplasm)
<br />Nucleolus at the center: creates Ribosomal RNA+proteins=Ribosomes
<br />Messenger RNA: carry the orders to Ribosomes
<br />

Wolves and Dogs are descended from common ancestors (which looked more like modern wolfs than dogs). Over many generations, Humans selected the ?favourable? traits (e.g., long shiny fur, or stocky legs etc) to produce the many different types / breeds of modern dogs that we have today. The keyword here is ?over many generations?. There are modern dogs that, of course, are still very much wolve-like in appearance (e.g., Huskies, German Shepherd etc). Some dog breeds are much less wolf-like in appearance (Chihuahua, Shih Tzu etc) as they have been artificially selected for their small size and ?cute? traits. So why is it known as artificial selection? This is because the Human (the dog breeders) are the ones determining which individual dogs they would prefer to produce offsprings, thereby continuing the genes they would like to retain. Prior to this, it is also important to understand the idea of Variation. This means that in a litter of puppies, not every puppy is physically identical (even though they may look identical to the untrained eyes). Some puppies have slightly longer legs, some shorter legs. Very small differences, but, yes, the differences are there. It is due to this physical variations that the breeders (humans) select which dogs possess the traits he wants, thus the term ?Artificial Selection?. This Selection process is repeated over many generations and the result is the modern dog breeds we have today.<br /><br />Once we understood Artificial Selection, it will be easy to understand Natural Selection. In Natural Selection, the environment aka Mother Nature (instead of Human) is the factor deciding which traits survive through the generations. How? One example is Food Source. Many species of birds have developed the ability to swim to obtain their food (Adaptability). One pre-requisite of aquatic birds is having water-proof feathers. In this case, this is the ?Favourable Trait?. One group of birds may live nearer to the seasides and Individual birds with better waterproof feathers is seen by Mother Nature as a ?favourable trait?. And so individual birds with this trait has a much higher chance of survival and passing on this gene to the next generations. Birds with ?less waterproof? feathers may probably not even live to adulthood as they had difficulties obtaining their food (in the sea), resulting in their genes being eliminated from this group of birds. Using an analogy, you may think of this  process as a kind of filtration process, where only the finest particles is able to pass through the fine filter. This is Adaptation, and it has to be highlighted that Adaptation takes place over many, many, many generations. Physical Adaptations (e.g., change in body shapes) DO NOT take place in just one generation. In other words, an individual animal will not change its form physically to obtain that trait in its lifetime, unless it?s metamorphosis which is a totally different thing.<br /><br />We also observed this in rabbits living in deserts and rabbits living in cold countries. The long ears in rabbits act as effective heat radiators. This enables the rabbits to lose body heat efficiently, just as how humans lose heat efficiently by sweating. The rabbits living in deserts adapted (over many generations) to the environment by developing very long and erect ears for highly efficient lowering of their body temperature. But rabbits living in cold countries tends to have shorter ears (some even have lop ears). Shorter ears is the ?favourable trait? here as it enables them to lose less body heat. All animals (and yes, that includes Humans) are still in the midst of Evolution. If Evolution is constantly ongoing, why can?t we see it happening? We need to understand that Evolution is a very, very slow on-going process. Evolution will never be ?complete?, as change is the only constant. If Evolution is true, why are there no animals that are ?neither here nor there? (i.e., in-between two species)? We need to remember humans are the ones who gave distinct names to different distinct species of animals in the first place. Let us look at the Seals / Walruses. Their ancestors are land animals, but their body shapes (flippers and hydrodynamic bodies) are hard evidence that they are in the midst of ?transition? from land animals to aquatic animals, as their main source of food is in the sea. Of course, we cannot see an appreciable change in their appearances in our lifetime, as the change is happening far too slowly over many generations. So presently, we can only imagine the current physical appearances of Seals / Walruses as being ?frozen-in-time?, as with the rest of the millions of species of animals currently living on this planet Earth. And do appreciate their beauty in their current physical form (and the diversity of the Tree of Life), as they will never be the same again one million years from now.', FROM_UNIXTIME(1549065600), null, 135),

This video is educational, but human embryonic development is much more complex than this.

The outer cells become the trophoblast, which is divided into the inner cytotrophoblast and the outer syntitiotrophoblast, which grows into the decidua of the uterus and later on becomes the placenta. The cytotrophoblast contains the embryoblast, which is comprised out of the epiblast, inside of which the amniotic cavity is formed, and the hypoblast, which creates the Heuser membrane, creating the wall of the primary yolk sac. Then it gets even more complicated with the extraembryonic mesoderm (or, due to historical reasons, mesenchyme), which divides into parietal and visceral parts and then combination of this and trophoblast forms the chorion, etc, etc. Gastrulation occurs in the epiblast, where the epiblast cells migrate towards the primitive streak, and in the process called invagination they are twisted inside, creating the three germ layers in humans - the ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm.

<br />? H2O uses a covalent bond: each hydrogen shares an electron with oxygen. It is thus a polar molecule.

<br />? Hydrogen bonds in water results in high cohesion, and thus high surface tension.
<br />? Cohesion is the attraction between two like things (e.g. two water molecules).
<br />? Water has the highest cohesion of any non-metallic liquid.
<br />? Adhesion is the attraction between two unlike things (e.g. water and glass).
<br />? Capillary action is water defying gravity.
<br />? Water is the greatest solvents (due to its polarity).
<br />? Hydrophilic molecules are polar ? their polarity is stronger than the cohesive forces of water.
<br />? Hydrophobic molecules cannot break the cohesive forces of water because they are non-polar.

Some a<br />fundamentalists also become Astrophysicists so that they can claim an Astrophysicist doesn&#x27;t believe in the Big Bang.<br /><br />Your teacher&#x27;s situation isn&#x27;t special or unique. They do that on purpose. It&#x27;s part of their mission, and they view it as missionary work for their god. There are also some racists who become biologists by getting Zoology degrees, so that they get credit for being a Biologist who believes one race is superior to another. Your teacher isn&#x27;t actually trying to understand Biology in it&#x27;s fullest, your Biology teacher is just trying to use their status to convince people.<br /><br />Many of the religious Conservative schools realize they need to fill positions to be accredited, and Biology is one area they need to fill. Some don&#x27;t hire liberals or people interested in education, and quietly hire only religious people. Some schools that aren&#x27;t aware of what fundamentalists do will hire people no matter what, for the sake of filling spots to educate kids, and they don&#x27;t realize that missionaries are infiltrating their schools.<br /><br />Could you imagine someone teaching Physics, without believing in the Scientific Theory of Relativity? It doesn&#x27;t make sense, right? But ANDREW SCHLAFLY, son of Conservative loon, Phyllis Schlafly (who fought against the Equal Rights Amendment for women), Andrew author of Conservapedia, Andrew fighter of ObamaCare and health care for all, Andrew believer of Noah&#x27;s Flood even though the pyramids have no water damage, Andrew who was in the same college class as Obama and has a degree... Andrew Schlafly home schools students and assists them in their science classes, but he believes Einstein&#x27;s Scientific Theory of Relativity is a &quot;liberal hoax&quot;. .....<br /><br />(The reason he believes this is because it&#x27;s the only way to solve the fact that light has been travelling from some galaxies for longer than 6,000 years to reach Earth, and the Bible requires him to believe that the Earth is 6,000 years old. Since he believes the Bible is true, then he believes that proven-true science is wrong. Instead, he should accept that Einstein&#x27;s theory has already been proven, and that the Bible is wrong. He can&#x27;t accept that.)<br /><br />So there&#x27;s nothing special about your Biology teacher denying the fact that Evolution is true.

I typed that from my phone, so I didn&#x27;t check your profile to see where you were from. But, I&#x27;m at a computer now.<br /><br />So Mumbai, huh? Is your teacher a follower of a specific ancient Indian scholar? (I know that foreign people often combine them together and just call it &quot;Hinduism&quot;, but that people follow different scholars, like religious divisions.) It&#x27;s interesting that this same argument is apparently going on in India. It shouldn&#x27;t even be an argument.<br /><br />In several Conservative Muslim countries, they&#x27;re also fighting against any teaching of evolution. Richard Dawkins did an interview with some Muslim students in a classroom (in an Islamic country, but I forgot where). The students said they don&#x27;t believe it, and they started using old bad arguments that American Christians used to use (but stopped using, because they were bad arguments). I think one of the arguments was &quot;If humans came from monkeys, then why are there still monkeys?&quot; ... Uh, we didn&#x27;t come from monkeys, we came from Homo Erectus, which is extinct now. But even if they hadn&#x27;t gone extinct, it would be because they don&#x27;t just all agree to change together. Some change, others don&#x27;t.<br /><br />So obviously you realize that evolution happened (and continues to happen). I assume that your Biology teacher is still teaching it, even though they don&#x27;t believe it?

Oxygen is then released from the plant.  This allows us to breathe.]<br />-The energized electrons from PSII that were picked up by the electron carriers are transported to the next protein complex, the Cytochrome Complex.<br />-The Cytochrome Complex serves stands between PSII and PSI (all embedded in the thylakoid membrane) and uses energy from the electrons to pump hydrogen ions into the thylakoid.<br />-Protons accumulated from the splitting of H2O and via the Cytochrome Complex now in the thylakoid then move toward the enzyme ATP synthase, which uses the energy to pack an inorganic phosphate onto ADP to create ATP.<br />-As electrons move along the Electron Transport Chain, they lose energy<br />-The ?tired? electrons become re-energized as it reaches Photosystem I and travels on another electron carrier, where all the energy is used to make NADPH.<br />*Products of Light Dependent reactions: chemical energy in the form of ATP and NADPH, and the by-product oxygen.<br /><br />LIGHT INDEPENDENT REACTIONS (STAGE 2):<br />-First phase of the Calvin Cycle is known as Carbon Fixation<br />-Begins in the stroma (empty space of chloroplast).  Involves fixing a CO2 molecule onto Ribulose Bisphosphate (RuBP) with the help of an enzyme RuBisCo.  This causes the RuBP to become unstable.<br />-This new 6-carbon chain has to break apart, creating two molecules of 3-phosphoglycerate, which occurs to three molecules of RuBP.<br />-Second phase of the Calvin Cycle is called Reduction.<br />-ATP combines a phosphate group onto the 3-phosphoglycerate and NADPH packs some electrons, creating 2 molecules of Glyceraldehyde 3-Phosphate (G3P).<br />-G3P is a high energy, 3-carbon compound that plants can convert into many carbohydrates such as glucose, cellulose, or starch.  (glucose=short term energy / cellulose=structure / starch=long term energy)<br />-The last phase of the Calvin Cycle is call Regeneration.<br />-9 ATPs and 6 NADPHs are required to convert the 3 RuBPs we started with into 6 G3Ps.  However, only one G3P can leave the cycle... the other 5 G3Ps are needed to regenerate the original RuBPs, completing one round of the cycle.<br /><br />Hope this helps!', FROM_UNIXTIME(1485993600), null, 350),

Before I begin explaining, it is important to understand that an &quot;orbit&quot; and an &quot;orbital&quot; are two completely different things. So every atom&#x27;s electrons occupy energy levels, which are also called orbits, which are those circles you see around the nucleus of an atom in those diagrams you see. An energy level could be 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on, and is usually represented in chemistry by the variable &quot;n&quot;. Note that these types of diagrams aren&#x27;t showing literally how the electrons look when they travel around a nucleus; that is dictated by energy sublevels, so try to put it out of your mind that electrons always look like circles around the nucleus all the time. These energy sublevels, are the s, p, d, and f that he was talking about. These sublevels dictate the shape of the path that the electrons are most likely to travel through; so basically, that&#x27;s what an orbital is: the shape of the path an electron is most likely to take when it travels around its nucleus. An orbital of the s sublevel looks like a plain circle; a p sublevel orbital looks like an infinity sign; a d sublevel orbital looks like a 4 leaf clover; an f sublevel orbital takes a shape that... really doesn&#x27;t have a name. Every orbital can hold a maximum of two electrons that have opposite spins, and every sublevel has a maximum capacity for orbitals; the s sublevel holds 1 orbital, the p sublevel holds 3, the d sublevel holds 5, the f sublevel holds 7, and so on. So now you might be thinking, okay, so it&#x27;ll be 1s 1p 1d 1f, then 2s 2p 2d and 2f, but in fact, that&#x27;s incorrect. Through Bohr&#x27;s discoveries, he found that the first energy level can only hold two electrons, the second can hold 8 electrons, the third can hold 8 electrons, the fourth can hold 18 electrons, and the fifth can also hold 18 electrons. You can actually see this in the periodic table; the first period only has 2 elements, the second period has 8, the third has 8, the fourth has 18, and the fifth also has 18. So in order from least to greatest energies, this is how energy levels and their sublevels are written; 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 4s, 3d, 4p, 5s, and so on as shown in the small graph below<br /><br />1s &lt;---<br />2s &lt;---<br />3s 2p &lt;---<br />4s 3p &lt;---<br />5s 4p 3d &lt;---<br />6s 5p 4d &lt;---<br />7s 6p 5d 4f &lt;---<br />8s 7p 6d 5f &lt;---<br /><br />Now a way that scientists show these is by using electron orbital diagrams, which is basically using boxes and arrows to show orbitals and electrons, as well as their spins, in an orbital (since I can&#x27;t form shapes I&#x27;ll just use brackets, ^ for up spinning electron, and v for down). There are, however, three exceptions to how electrons are filled into energy levels of atoms, and these rules must also be followed when creating an electron orbital diagram of the configuration of electrons.?<br /><br />-Electrons fill orbitals of the lowest energy first (Aufbau Principle)<br /><br />Example: 1s [^ v] 2s[ ? ] ?and then 1s[^ v] 2s [^ ?]<br />? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?<br />-A maximum of two electrons can fit in an orbital, but they must have opposite spins (Pauli Exclusion Principle)?<br /><br />Example: 1s [^ v] ? ? ? ? ? ?<br /><br />This would be wrong --&gt; 1s [^ ^] or this 1s [^ v]<br /><br />-Electrons will fill all orbitals of a sublevel with one electron before pairing up (Hund&#x27;s Rule)<br /><br />Example:<br /><br />First fill in each of 2p&#x27;s orbitals with one electron<br /><br />1s [^ v] 2s [^ v] 2p [^ ?] [^ ?] [^ ?]<br /><br />Then fill the rest of the missing spots with electrons with opposite spins<br /><br />1s [^ v] 2s [^ v] 2p [^ v] [^ v] [^ v]<br /><br />Note that in every element, not all of their orbitals will be filled with electrons. Elements that do not have all of their orbitals satisfied because they still have unpaired electrons are called paramagnetic. Those that do have all of their electrons paired are called diamagnetic. Electromagnetic fields have more effect on atoms that are paramagnetic. Now as Hank mentioned, noble gasses are non-reactive. This is because they are all diamagnetic, and all of their electrons are paired. Let&#x27;s take the electron configuration of neon for example.<br /><br />1s [^ v] 2s [^ v] 2p [^ v] [^ v] [^ v]<br /><br />As you can see, all of neon&#x27;s electrons are paired. Now sometimes, you may be asked to write down the electron configuration of an atom. This is basically the written version of an electron orbital diagram. In the case of Neon, its electron configuration would be-<br /><br />? ? 2 ? ? ?2 ? ? 6<br />1s ? ?2s ? ?2p<br /><br />The superscript number is showing how many electrons are in that entire sublevel. By dividing that number by two, that will tell you how many orbitals are in that sublevel, because each orbital can hold a pair of electrons. Now say you had an element like Magnesium (Mg). The electron configuration of that would be-<br /><br />? ? 2 ? ? ?2 ? ? 6 ? ? 2<br />1s ? ?2s ? ?2p ? 3s<br /><br />Electron configurations can be abbreviated using noble gasses like this-<br /><br />? ? ? ? ? ?2<br />(Ne) 3s<br /><br />Another important matter to note are valence electrons. Valence electrons are electrons in the outermost energy level or an atom and are usually the only electrons involved in chemical processes.

It will cause SOME humidity to drop do to cooling. The ground tends to stay around ~65F (I&#x27;m an American obviously) which is pretty comfortable. I would STRONGLY encourage you to look into &quot;Earth ships&quot; like those built out in Arizona.<br /><br />You can also get white sheets/tarps or even better mylar blankets and put it above the roof and use it to reflect the suns heat, you want it ABOVE not on the roof so there&#x27;s a slight air gap. It&#x27;ll prevent your (usually dark and thus heat absorbing roof) from absorbing as much energy. You can also just paint your roof a brighter color the brighter the more heat it&#x27;ll reflect.<br /><br />Because you specifically live in a high humidity environment I&#x27;d look into &quot;desiccants&quot; they are materials that are very well suited for absorbing ambient moisture from the air. You will see large wheels filled with pellets, etc of it in HVAC systems commercially used to control humidity using less energy. The idea being you would place those at the end of the geothermal loops I mentioned above so as much moisture drops do to the slight cooling; then have them go through a desiccant wheel that you&#x27;ll change once a day or so. That&#x27;ll really lower the ambient humidity and help keep you cooler, if the home is fairly well sealed, if not I wouldn&#x27;t bother with the desiccants. you&#x27;ll want to build a solar powered heat collector and put the desiccant wheels in that so they get good and hot and dry out, then you can reuse them.<br /><br />Once you have humidity under control you could use a &quot;swamp cooler&quot; to assist with lowering the temperature inside the home.<br /><br />The Earthships I mentioned are lived in the Arizona desert which gets extremely hot, honestly I&#x27;d take notes from them. You can put down rows of mylar overhead on the top of the earthship to prevent the ground from absorbing heat. The idea is if you build your home into the ground you&#x27;ll be surrounded on all sides by the stabilizing effects of the 65F average.

In October of 2017, researchers released a viable hack against WPA2, known as KRACK Attack, which uses AES to ensure secure communication between computers and network routers. The problem isn&#x27;t with AES, which is provably secure, but with the communication protocol between router and computer. In order to set up secure communication, the computer and router have to agree through what&#x27;s called a &quot;handshake&quot;.  If this handshake is interrupted in just the right way, an attacker can cause the handshake to fault to an insecure state and reveal critical information which makes the connection insecure. As is often the case with these situations, the problem is with an implementation, not the secure algorithm itself.

However, there&#x27;s a lot more logic that goes into how a cache works.<br /><br />Caches aren&#x27;t addressable. They&#x27;re fully managed by the processor itself. What the CPU does is it stores blocks of about typically 1024 bytes each, along with a small amount of memory to denote what range of addresses it represents. This whole block and the extra data is called a cache line. When a request is made for a value from RAM, the CPU first checks every cache line (there can be hundreds to thousands, depending on the size of the cache), comparing the address range associated with each tag to the address in RAM that it&#x27;s looking for. If it finds a cache line containing the data it&#x27;s looking for, it can read/write to that cache line directly. If it&#x27;s not there, it checks another cache. Caches are normally structured in a hierarchy with small, fast &quot;local&quot;  caches for each core (128kB - 512kB normally), and with larger, slower &quot;shared&quot; caches between multiple cores (multiple MB). Often times the larger shared caches store copies of all data stored in the local caches, so searching the shared cache is essentially the same as searching all the caches. As data is accessed, various additional CPU logic is able to move data between RAM and the caches. The goal is to have the processor organize the data such that data that the CPU needs to work with more is kept closer to the cores, and less important data is kept further away. This is important because accessing RAM on modern CPUs has latency in the hundreds of clock cycles; essentially, if the CPU makes a request for a value from RAM, it can run several hundred instructions before it gets the value back.<br /><br />There&#x27;s also the problem of cache coherency though, which occurs when you have writeable multiple caches. If you have multiple cache lines that represent the same data, then it becomes very easy to introduce inconsistencies in the memory. You can have one cache that says that the byte at address 1481 is equal to 13, while another cache might say it&#x27;s equal to 127. Which do you use? Which do you store back in RAM when you&#x27;re done?<br /><br />CPUs solve cache coherency by having a lot of very complex logic to track where different data is stored. This works for small numbers of caches, but not for larger systems. For example, Intel has their &quot;Xeon Phi&quot; processors; if you&#x27;re willing to fork over several thousand dollars for a supercomputer-grade CPU, you can get one with up to 72 cores. The problem is that you have 72 caches as well, and it uses the same on-chip network to manage cache coherency as it does to search the caches. This means that searching all the caches can, worst case scenario, take almost as long as just going out to RAM. It also means that memory bandwidth suffers as well. From what I&#x27;ve heard, even Intel engineers have difficulty getting even half of the theoretical bandwidth.<br /><br />GPUs solve cache coherency by having a mix of caches and &quot;scratchpad memory.&quot; Scratchpad memory is a fully-addressable block of memory on a CPU. The problem with it is that the programmer (or compiler) has to manage it themselves. However, a great advantage is that you don&#x27;t need to worry at all about cache coherency because it&#x27;s not a cache. Each compute unit (basically a large number of small, simple GPU cores that all work together on the same task) has it&#x27;s own block of scratchpad memory (usually 32-128kB), and it&#x27;s own small read-only cache. The cache keeps frequently used memory nearby, however if the compute unit attempts to write any data to it, then the data in the cache line is moved to the single, large shared cache on the GPU, including the data written to it. The associated cache line is then erased and a message is sent out to all local caches on the chip to purge all copies of the data that they may store.<br /><br />If all of this sounds horribly inefficient and poorly scalable, that&#x27;s because it is. Caches consume A LOT of power, much of which goes to searching hundreds or thousands of cache lines every time the CPU runs a memory instruction. Running an instruction to perform a 64-bit operation, on average, consumes about 16x less power than getting a 64-bit value from RAM, not including all the cache searches. If we include the cache searches, that goes up to 40x more power.<br /><br />What about scratchpad memory? It&#x27;s nowhere near as wasteful in terms of power usage. It works like shown in the video. Pretty efficient. The main reasons why we don&#x27;t switch to it are that caches are much more convenient from a programming perspective, and because it would require that all existing software (including all the legacy software) would have to be completely rewritten to take advantage of it. Plus there&#x27;s a bit of a stigma against it because the PS3 used it and a lot of people hated programming that thing. Of course, GPUs use it, so maybe that stigma will start to go away.<br /><br />For a comparison, Adapteva announced a few months ago a 1024-core CPU (technically it&#x27;s more of a coprocessor, as it can&#x27;t run most operating systems on it&#x27;s own. I&#x27;ll call it a CPU though because that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s closest to). CPUs are normally much less energy efficient than GPUs, part of that having to have more complex control logic due to more flexibility in what it can do (GPUs are very restrictive). Adapteva&#x27;s CPU uses ONLY scratchpad memory. No caches at all. As a result, it&#x27;s about 2-3x more energy efficient than even NVidia&#x27;s Pascal GPUs, which are the most efficient GPUs currently available (NVidia&#x27;s marketing included that they spent so much money on R&amp;D to improve efficiency, that they could have sent people to Mars for less), despite being at a disadvantage for being a CPU, and being developed mostly by one engineer. Of course, Adapteva doesn&#x27;t have a lot of customers though.<br /><br />I think the future will probably include a mix of scratchpad and caches. You can still use caches without cache coherency if you&#x27;re careful, so people will find more arguments in favor of the convenience and backwards compatibility. Sorry for writing a textbook here.

As a CS major myself, this is actually finally a series where I can answer questions and stuff in the comment section! Just a pedantic note for people who want a little more info:<br /><br />1) There are also not versions of all the gates. AND, OR, and XOR become NAND, NOR, XNOR, respectively. They are represented by adding a small circle to the end of the gate. While they can be formed just by adding a not gate at the end of the inputs, they are common enough that they get their own specialized parts. You often here people verbally NAND and XNOR when talking about logic, so I think it is interesting to note even though this isn&#x27;t computer engineering.<br /><br />2) While by convention in truth tables 1 is true and 0 is false, this is often not the case when we actually look at real components. Because of power usage, the opposite is often used. Generally, the more common output is set to 0.<br /><br />3) 0 doesn&#x27;t actually mean nothing is flowing through. For example, we may set our 1 to 5 volts, and our 0 to 2.3 volts. This allows for us to have an &quot;off&quot; state at 0 volts. We wouldn&#x27;t want our computer to be calculating stuff with 0s when it is off!

However, in academia, it is a bit more in depth. O(n) is instead used to represent an upperbound (in the WORST CASE, what is this problem or algorithm). ?(n) (pronounced &quot;big-omega&quot;) is used to represent the lowerbound (in the BEST CASE, what is this problem or algorithm). ?(n), prounounced &quot;theta&quot; (without the &quot;big&quot;) is used to represent the tightbound (used when the big-oh is equal to the big-omega, which is the exact running time). There is also small omega and small o, but those are rarely used.<br /><br />Also, we only care about the biggest polynomial when we use this notation. So if a problem takes 5n^4 + 3n^2 + 1 to do, we just say it is ?(n^4). We drop the coefficient and smaller terms because we only care about what happens when n is really really big.<br /><br />You may notice that earlier I mentioned algorithm or problem when describing the notation. This is because the it is often used in academia to denote all of the algorithms that exist for a problem. For example, for matrix multiplication of an n x n matrix, we have ?(n^2), since we know that we at least need to read in n^2 values.

For example, when we look at all the items, we remember what we saw before and can change more than one thing at once (e.g. &quot;oh, I remember that was the smallest before I found the actual smallest, so that&#x27;s the second smallest. Let me put both of them first and second right now, saving myself a re-look&quot;). I know computers are still faster in the end, but I suspect that&#x27;s because we physically cannot write or move objects around as quickly as a computer can physically write data (and possibly our brain has a slower &quot;clock speed&quot;), rather than computational efficiency.

The duration of the audio pause during the cut is similar to that of the space between words being spoken. So although it&#x27;s a new sentence, it&#x27;s jarring because linguistically it does not sound like a new sentence. And this continues constantly throughout the video. I know that the idea is to keep things fast and exciting, and this technique works great for entertainment Vlogs, but it doesn&#x27;t work so well in teaching physics. The net effect after a few minutes of the fast cuts is viewer exhaustion. It&#x27;s like a never ending sentence that is being spoken. I&#x27;d recommend changing the editing technique.

The diversity of topics and depth of insight is something that is, in my opinion, unrivaled by most other YouTube channels. The idea of this channel alone, that being videos of moderate length explaining a range of topics in detail, is priceless. Now more than ever it is vitally important to the American economy that our citizens be intellectually literate, especially in fields such as science and technology. Come to think of it, it may be a good idea for you guys to make a STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) playlist. Just a thought.<br /><br />On another note, what would you guys/girls (meaning whoever is reading this) of an interview series on Crash Course? It would be really interesting to see Crash Course collaborate with scientists, artists, authors, poets... etc. Couple that with longer interviews with the guest and I think it would have the potential to really grow the channel and even further diversify the content, appealing to a different breed of knowledge junkie. I can only hope that some high profile names in the various fields of expertise would be willing to collaborate. Richard Dawkins for biology, Lawrence Krauss for particle physics, Bill Nye for climate change and engineering, Cornell West for social and political reformation and history, and so on and so forth. I believe that and do of those names have collaborated with the channel Big Think (which is another channel that I love), and they have only have about 1/3rd of the amount of subscribers that Crash Course has.

Pffft, we went cannonball-style into complex math.  That&#x27;s... not how CC usually goes into things.  I feel lost and I KNOW this stuff.  Given how much physics is SO huge in life?  This just is like a math class with a word problem that looooosely relates life.  I&#x27;m really surprised a compleeeeetely different approach to this wasn&#x27;t taken.

Can you jump without falling? Do you know how high you are? How fast are you going to fall, and would the force break your bones if you tried???  Welp! Physics can help you with that!

We haven&#x27;t even gotten a hardcore truly deep explanation of basic things like force and velocity and gravity and energy and exertion and units of speed and...all of those!  Just a couple quick definitions and then moving along super fast using all those at once together instead of understanding each independently.  Why would you even mention Calculus already??  Some people don&#x27;t even graduate HS with that class EVER?  I mean, I get its necessity in physics, but we JUST started.  I feel like this just lost a massive amount of the audience who&#x27;ll be too intimidated to even try to come back.  The people that already know and love it and are into this?  Yes, ofc they&#x27;re going to dig it.  But CC is about accessibility and giving knowledge to all skill levels.  ..while also going into super complex stuff where beginners can pause and digest if they need.  But we&#x27;ve not really given them the basics.  I&#x27;m so confused by the intent here.  <br /><br />If 28yo&#x27;s who have done all this can be overwhelmed and struggle to follow.

Some kids in my HS didn&#x27;t even get to Physics before graduation (Earth/Space, Bio, and Chem) bc they hadn&#x27;t had the math required to understand this before graduating.  But still there&#x27;s TONS of physics to be taught and learned and devoured with more simplistic math to start until you work up to higher levels.  <br /><br />I know these tools are important to move ahead, but not only did we jump into anything-but-basic material already on episode two, it doesn&#x27;t feel at all like CC -- just a class... like &quot;do this, cuz this, then, that? get it. good. cuz i do. easy. moving on&quot;.  But it also doesn&#x27;t do Physics and why it&#x27;s SO fascinating much justice.  I can imagine (and HOPE!) some of that&#x27;s coming, but the couple introductory episodes should really hook people in to being like omgggg, that&#x27;s so cool!

And most take it in their senior year (some smartypantses junior).  You cannot &quot;get on to some real physics&quot; without calculus. ...and you absolutely cannot teach Calc in a hot minute.

It was valuable and opened my eyes and other people&#x27;s eyes.  It didn&#x27;t even TOUCH what has been touched on in episode three.

Absolutely any other series, I can sit down and watch it beginning to end....no matter how long I&#x27;ve been outta school.  This doesn&#x27;t allow that.

But this feels like a big, big miss.  Great for college.  Great for maaaaybe maybe a few advanced high schoolers.  But unless they dramatically turn into way more accessible presentations?  Starting this advanced is only going to serve the AP kids and college kids.  ...and, I still worry, intimidate anyone wanting to take physics in the future.   I know if 15 yo me had seen this?

You cannot &quot;get on to some real physics&quot; without calculus. ...and you absolutely cannot teach Calc in a hot minute.

As explained in the video, we need to think of the particle as waves (having momentum) or particles (having position). The Fourier transform let&#x27;s you go between these different spaces (momentum space / position space) but it kind of &quot;bundles up&quot; a range of values into a single value when changing space, and that gives you the uncertainty. <br /><br />For example, imagine a sinus wave, just a wavy rope going from the left to right. Now, rotate your viewing position to one end of the rope so that the wave travels straight from your position. From this point, it would look like a vertical line. So even if the wave was very irregular with different heights at different nodes, from this perspective, we would only see a single vertical line. We have thus &quot;bundled up&quot; a range of different values, and we can&#x27;t be certain what the height of the rope would be at different positions, but we know it&#x27;s within the range of our vertical line.<br /><br />So the uncertainty principle is a purely mathematical restriction which was known long before quantum mechanics, but took a practical meaning after the discovery of quantum mechanics.', FROM_UNIXTIME(1517529600), null, 314),

Because I think colors and vision are interesting and I&#x27;d love people to have a better understanding of both color and statistics.<br /><br />The first obvious suggestion is that the visible spectrum is composed of wavelengths of light. You probably know that visible light spans a wide range of colors from looking at a rainbow that splits up the many different wavelengths (ROYGBIV). Obviously if someone picks &quot;red&quot; or &quot;blue&quot; you can point to a place in the visible spectrum where the light is red or blue and assign their color a wavelength, right? Well ... white isn&#x27;t part of the rainbow. There is no single wavelength that corresponds to white. White is a mix of many wavelengths of light which our brain interprets as white. And black is of course the absence of light, so there&#x27;s no wavelength to assign it. Worse, it turns out that if you get more specific in terms of your favorite color (not &quot;red&quot; but &quot;crimson&quot;, not &quot;blue&quot; but &quot;cerulean&quot;) then that exact color is probably not single wavelength but rather a combination of many wavelengths. <br /><br />For the sake of argument though, let&#x27;s add up all the values we can represent (ignoring white, black, grey, brown, pink, gold, silver, etc etc) and we will absolutely get the average color as some shade of green, barring some really intense skew in people&#x27;s favorite colors. Green is in the mid range of the visible light spectrum and unless an absolutely massive proportion of the people favor blue/purple or red/orange, the average will be green. The exact shade of green will vary depending on whether or not you do some fiddling to make the visible spectrum more &quot;even&quot; than it actually is.<br /><br />The second suggestion is that our computers model color for us through Red, Green, and Blue light. This is a cool trick based on the fact that we don&#x27;t individually detect specific wavelengths. Our eyes are composed of three types of color receptors (cones) which are each most active in a certain part of the visible spectrum. These cones report back their activation levels and from that our brain constructs a perceived color based on how much each of the cones in a particular particular part of the eye are active. There&#x27;s even a cool trick that because our Red cones are slightly active in the violet-end of the visible spectrum we can combine Blue and Red light to create Purple! That&#x27;s really cool and allows us to smoothly transition from violet back to red by reducing the amount of blue light even though those points are on opposite ends of the visible light spectrum and a direct wavelength transition between those values should require us to pass through green. Instead we perceive those two ends as linked - almost like the visible spectrum is a &quot;color wheel&quot;.<br /><br />Now, even though RGB does not allow us to encode every visible color, it does give us a more nuanced system for capturing colors that involve multiple wavelengths at once - or even no wavelength! We can capture white, black, grey, brown, and many other colors that aren&#x27;t handled by a single wavelength. We can also capture the same wavelength at multiple levels of brightness so we can distinguish someone who likes &quot;light red&quot; from someone who likes &quot;dark red&quot;. If we build RGB representations of each of their favorite colors and average out those RGB values, we can calculate an average value and it will be some shade of grey, possibly with a hint of one of the three channels being higher or lower than the others. Because roughly equal amounts of Red, Green, and Blue light will make some shade of grey.<br /><br />A variant on this suggestion though is that when we print we use a different color model. Instead of RGB (which is based on adding light together), most printers use the CMYK model (which is based on mixing inks that subtract light from a piece of white paper). Using Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and blacK, we represent all our colors using 4 values, mix them together, print out the average and get brown. Because when you mix roughly equal amounts of Cyan, Magenta, and Yellow you get a brownish color, then darkened by however much blacK gets used.<br /><br />I&#x27;d like to pause and take a moment to think about what happens when we calculate averages in other places in statistics. If we calculate everyone&#x27;s height in inches and take the average, then switch to centimeters and take the average ... we&#x27;ll get the same answer. If we calculate average people&#x27;s age in years, then do it in minutes, we&#x27;ll end up with (minus some rounding problems) the same answer. If we average everyone&#x27;s income in USD, then convert it to Euros and average it ... we&#x27;ll end up with the same answer.<br /><br />But here we&#x27;ve taken three different ways of measuring and representing colors, averaged the inputs in each of them, and gotten wildly different results. No one would mistake green, grey, and brown as being the same colors, so something weird is happening here.<br /><br />Let&#x27;s try one last thing in hopes that we can resolve this. Rather than resorting to CMYK or RGB systems which are outputting in a limited number of channels, let&#x27;s go one step further. We ask everyone to bring in an object they own that is their favorite color. Then we&#x27;ll point a light sensor at it and measure ALL the wavelengths coming off the object, average how much of each wavelength is coming off the objects in question, and then we&#x27;ll have our absolutely accurate answer.<br /><br />Your assistant shows up carrying two purple objects and says &quot;both of these are my favorite color, but I couldn&#x27;t decide which one to bring, so let&#x27;s measure both of them and take their average.&quot; You agree and measure the light coming off one of them, then the light coming off the other ... and then hang your head in defeat. The two objects have very different sets of wavelengths being measured, yet your eyes consider them indistinguishable. Where one of the two purple objects is mostly reflecting violet light, the other&#x27;s color appears to have been made by mixing blue and red paint so it reflects very little violet light and much more red and blue. Showing your assistant the average of the two brings a shake of the head, &quot;that&#x27;s still purple, but it doesn&#x27;t look like either of them!&quot; In fact, there could be hundreds or thousands of combinations of wavelengths that all map to this same shade of purple, because just as our computer shows millions of shades using only 3 wavelengths, the natural world is reflecting hundreds of thousands of wavelengths that we only perceive as intensities in our 3 types of cones.<br /><br />In the end, we&#x27;re left wondering why it&#x27;s so hard to pick an average color - we have 4 systems that assign numbers to colors, but they give conflicting answers. This is an important distinction then between a numerical representation and a measurement. You can measure the number of pets in each household and determine the mean number of pets each person has - that&#x27;s great. But if you assign a number to each of those types of animals (1 = dog, 2 = cat, 3 = goldfish, etc), you&#x27;ve created a numerical representation of a qualitative value. If you then average THOSE values, you do not end up with a meaningful result - especially since you could just change the values in your representation and get a different answer. <br /><br />Wavelengths of light are interpreted by our brains as colors, and while wavelengths are a physical phenomenon you can measure, &quot;color&quot; is not a one-to-one measurement of the physical world.', FROM_UNIXTIME(1549065600), null, 24),

Many thanks for that!<br /><br />I had finished my master thesis in psychology at University of Warsaw and I am really shocked how little knowledge of statistics psychologists/ psychiatrists have (yes, non-psychologists, this topic is consisted of 70% of statistics, methodology, testing, experiments, designs etc. and only in 30% of ideas of such individuals as Freud, Horney, Maslow or Pavlov). 5 years of studying this field have given me two sad conclusions about methodology of verifying new thesis of psychology: <br /><br />1. Even psychology PhDs/ professors (globally, not only in Poland) have just a tiny tiny (if any!) knowledge of basics of statistics (no one, except statistic tutors, cares about normal distribution, skewness of the frequencies, size of the sample and type of the sample when it comes to analyzing the data). As I was helping other students to deal with statistics, I was facing a really shocking attitudes towards stats from PhDs/ professors like &quot;hey, I don&#x27;t have a clue on what to do with gathered material, so let&#x27;s do anything - correlation (r Pearsons test) or causation (t Student&#x27;s test), whatever&quot;. That freaked me out a bit as I started to think that really so little psychology PhDs/ professors really know what they are talking about in their papers... <br /><br />Moreover, as I was looking for some literature for my masters, about 50-70% of ALREADY PRINTED papers was a garbage data IMO. Like &quot;hey, I just did a research on 50 Iranian/Polish/American (any nation is applicable) students from 1st year - 35 female and 15 male. I pushed it through the SPSS machine (pushed some buttons and some numbers occur, yay!) and the conclusion is that generally speaking FEMALE are more open to xxx than man (place whatever you want instead of &quot;xxx&quot; (and yet - please don&#x27;t make me write every mistake made in this description because it will take me another 15 minutes to summarize it :) ). <br /><br />2. (Which is the result of point 1) If such honored people around the world rarely cares about the key assumptions to be fulfilled, how come a. other students would be able to learn stuff? b. how come these students will be able to verify the meaning of their data? c. therefore, how future thesis would be verified if we both get rid of any theoretical assumptions and forget about statistical knowledge? d. what comes next?<br /><br />Another topic is also the machine of printing scientific papers and the silence of the experiments that did not fit to the already assumed thesis (or those which just crushed the thesis), but it is a whole new area of discussion... :)', FROM_UNIXTIME(1549065600), null, 15),

The covariate (e.g. the baby&#x27;s age) is your X variable, and the Y variable is your response as usual (baby weight gain). In the simplest case, each group gets its own line [y=bx+a] with the same slope (b), but different intercepts (a1, a2, etc.); in this case, one intercept for each baby formula type. Lines that have the same slope but differ in intercept will appear parallel, but at different &quot;heights&quot; on the plot: this would mean, in this case, that age has the same overall effect on weight gain, but one formula gives a higher &quot;baseline&quot; weight gain at any given time point than the other.<br /><br />So the p value for your covariate is an answer to the question &quot;is there a significant effect, i.e. a nonzero slope, of X (age) on Y (weight gain)?&quot;, while the p value for your grouping variable is the answer to the question &quot;is there a significant difference in intercept between the regression line for one type of formula and the regression line of the other type of formula?&quot; In this case, there was a significant difference - and reorganizing the data according to an X variable (age) made us able to detect this difference, whereas when age was not considered, all data around each regression line was smushed together around a single mean, obscuring the effect of formula with a whole lot of noise. This is why the p value changed when age was added.<br /><br />If an interaction term is included, it tests for a difference in slope between the groups. So an age-by-formula interaction might mean, for example, that weight gain is similar shortly after birth, but it makes a difference which formula you use later on in the baby&#x27;s life. This would appear in the regression plot as two lines (representing the formula types) that are close together near X=0, but move apart farther to the right on the X-axis (as age increases) because one line is steeper than the other.', FROM_UNIXTIME(1549065600), null, 54),

If you just pay a scientist (=prolong the grant) if he publishes, thus if he has to publish to not starve, so he will publish no matter what ... that&#x27;s exactly as intended. As unfortunately scientific discoveries can&#x27;t be forced and are often just luck, but the scientist has to publish something ... anything to not end up as a hobo, so he will find something ... anything to publish. If not hell make something up if necessary. Bending the truth is bad .. being without a place to live is worse, so guess what people do ? What do you expect ? Ruining your life. just to be honest ? Seriously .. just drop the measurement that doesn&#x27;t fit the intended explanation and everything will be fine. That&#x27;s not even lying or faking data, it&#x27;s giving people what they want.. The same, but even worse is true for PhD students. Without a PhD you are academically dead meat and can think about driving a taxi for Uber or working as callboy in the future to not starve. To avoid these unpleasant alternatives you&#x27;ll do anything to find something, somehow that&#x27;s publishable. If it is reproducible or relevant is completely irrelevant, because you need the money to not starve and pay the rent.<br />In the end it works exactly as it was intended: financial incentives (=not starving) lead to an increase in the number of papers (= formally scientific progress) and everyone is happy. The scientists don&#x27;t starve the people founding it get their papers, so everything is dandy, well until they find out 20 years later, that 90% of all the stuff published ain&#x27;t worth the paper it used to be printed on because it is scientific junk (and that&#x27;s not only true for pseudo &quot;sciences&quot; like social &quot;sciences&quot;, but also for hard natural sciences). In economics such unintended outcome due to wrongly set incentives is called cobra effect. The real problem here is that scientific progress can&#x27;t be forced. If one tries to force people to do something that they can&#x27;t really influence, they&#x27;ll find another way to somehow comply with the requirements... and the result is scientific junk. As long as the incentives are set towards mass production of papers and not towards producing real scientific research, this won&#x27;t change. As a result does every scientist know that a newly published paper ain&#x27;t worth anything until it has been reproduced several times by independent (=not affiliated) labs.<br />The major problem here is not science ... the problem is people who don&#x27;t understand science, ruining it by thinking that something unknown and never done before can be solved by just throwing money at the problem and putting pressure on people.

The polls were mostly right (In the sense that the average errors of 2016 were less than the average errors of all polling since 1998), and showed a tight race in the crucial states that Trump won in the end. The polls didn&#x27;t fully catch the shifts happening late in the campaign (But that is also hard, as you need several days of polling and compiling before you can get a poll out, at which point a predictor has to spend days to read and assess it...), but they were showing the races were increasingly within the margins of error in certain Rust Belt states. <br />Two very common errors among predictors (Not pollsters) were to insert their own biases into the mix and to treat margins of error as static, uncorrelated and unimportant. Biases were often in analysis, where people who should know better because they had the numbers treated states as part of a blue wall, certain to go for Democrats. They looked at Trumps dismal favoured/unfavoured numbers without also comparing those numbers to Clintons. Making bad predictions in politics is just as often a question about interpreting which numbers are important and which aren&#x27;t, and even good predictors cannot have a perfect track record; sometimes it really is just a cointoss and a gut instinct. <br />Margins of error in election polling are a bit complicated to get right. While the basic interpretation is as you put it (54% +/- 2 prcpts means anywhere between 52 and 56 is expected), that&#x27;s not the only information such a number gives you. If a later poll of the same election gives 54% but the margin of error is increasing (Say, +/- 5 prcpts), that is a sign of increasing volatility and less predictive power in the polling. <br />At the same time, margins of error are often assumed to be random due to sample selection (I.e. margins of error are uncorrelated). If I did 10 polls, 3 of which gave 53%, 4 of which gave 54 and 3 of which gave 55, all with a +/- 5 prcpts, under almost all circumstances I&#x27;d be more certain that the 54% is right than with just 1 poll - I would expect the margins of error to be random, and thus cancel out the random noise. In such a case, I&#x27;d allow myself to average the polls and ignore the margin. However, if my sampling is just a bit off, and I have made essentially the same mistake in my 10 (nonrandom) samples, such a move would actually be wrong. I can&#x27;t be certain that my average is more accurate than any individual poll, and thus a result of 48-50 cannot be ruled out (Likewise a result of 58-60, but that&#x27;s not an election changer). <br />Furthermore, if there are several simultaneous elections, each with a discrete outcome, treating polls as uncorrelated doesn&#x27;t just deny me my sense of certainty, but small errors might also throw off the entire result. If I have 10 elections, each with polls showing 55%-45% and a margin of error at 7 prcpts, I may be relatively convinced that, on the whole, the party ahead will win more than half of these elections, possibly all, while the party behind will certainly lose most. However, if that margin correlates 1:1 between these elections, such that all ten elections in a sense &quot;share&quot; the same 7 prcpts margin of error, it would be an error to give 10 discrete election predictions. The most accurate answer would be a range of percentages for one outcome, namely either party winning the whole lot. That was a particular error in 2016, where most predictors did assume that margins of error were uncorrelated, which meant that 52%-48% and 3 prcpts margin in several states meant safe sailings for Clinton because she didn&#x27;t need all of the states for the Electoral College. <br />Last, a big part of the apparent error in polling was actually journalists misunderstanding the statistics behind, and thus communicating bad analysis to the public. A 52-48 poll may be the headline, but if the journalist doesn&#x27;t understand the vital role of the 3 prcpts margin of error, they will misinterpret the overall results. Seeing 52-48 as a continuum of 49-55 for one party and 45-51 for the other may not be easy to wrap your head around for anyone who doesn&#x27;t know how difficult sampling is, and it may be harder to communicate to a reader, but it gives a more honest assessment of the relative chances of winning. <br />You cite Nate Silver several times, who has gone over these various factors in more depth than I have here, and his presidential prediction was pretty much spot on: Clinton won the popular vote as we knew she would, and it was incredibly close in the states his model predicted - those states where Trump won by a few thousand votes that decided those particular, discrete outcomes and thus the election. <br /><br />Of course part of what makes Nate Silver a better statistician than most is that he embraces Bayesian logic and methodology, which are far superior to Fishers&#x27;.', FROM_UNIXTIME(1549065600), null, 2),

Where the pollsters were wrong is how these votes were spread out over the country - and Trump had the advantage here, by doing better than expected in the midwest, where there are several swing states. (both also won by a higher-than-expected margin in their heartlands)<br />But I agree with you that the main reason that Nate gave Trump much higher chances than others is that he explicitly did consider that the &#x27;polling mistake&#x27; in various states was likely to be highly correlated, and also which states would correlate most.', FROM_UNIXTIME(1549065600), '5dEPRUXut2yfEsHrSepOWKEfvgVPuA5vz7Y9XfYw9h59JwUSOJm37bbYIu0ThPzb', 1),

The &#x27;regional affair&#x27; is a good point in more recent (Post-1980 or there about) US elections, but many state-by-state polls did make up for it in 2016. Personally I followed the election pretty close, and throughout late October I saw enough state polls in the Midwest that I got worried from across the Atlantic. Nate Silver&#x27;s forecast was a huge help there, of course. <br />The close state races also revealed a mistake that many predictors did, namely expecting a (small and decreasing) lead in the crucial Midwestern states to mean a safe win for Clinton. If you don&#x27;t read the margins of error properly, a 51-49 lead with 3 prcpts margins across several states sounds like an Electoral College landslide. However, even if those margins are uncorrelated, some of those states might fall the other way. Treating &quot;ahead&quot; as &quot;won&quot;, rather than &quot;likely win&quot; further added to the 99:1 odds narrative. The 538 approach of giving a likelihood for each state individually and calculating from there, rather than adding up EC-votes in &quot;won&quot; or &quot;secure&quot; states, has clearly shown itself to be more accurate. I also think that was why they went with population governed as a metric for the gubernatorial elections in 2018, as it&#x27;s les susceptible to each discrete outcome. <br />In the end, though, as we agree, the national polling was fairly accurate though not perfect.

The shape of your daily electricity consumption of a particular month compared to same month last year. It may not be exactly the same, but can you say it&#x27;s similar enough, or is there a big spike/ difference for some reason<br />The distribution of data can be normal, left/right skewed, bi/multi-modal<br />The normal distribution (also called bell curve) is symmetric, where mean, median and mode is the same and data folds in exact halfs around it. The standard deviation is the average distance of a data point from the mean. 68% of all data falls within one standard deviation on either side of the mean. So smaller the standard deviation, skinnier is the normal distribution.<br />The distribution can also be skewed, with the peak being towards the left (positive skewed) or right (negative skewed) with longer tails on either side of the box plot. The std dev is higher in these cases as the mean is pulled towards the higher values of the range. Box plots of these can help us visually predict the std dev, range and mean.<br />The data can also be bi/multi-modal having two or more peaks. These look like two/multiple unimodal distributions pasted side by side. Often times they are two separate processes producing these distributions being measured as together eg. Times of geyser eruptions, completion times of a marathon ( Professionals/participants)<br />A final kind of distribution is the uniform distribution where wach value has an equal chance of occuring eg. Dice. This may be true theoretically, but the distribution of a die roll may not be uniform for all values when plotted. Though our machine/process is set for it. Does this mean we need to keep rolling the die ? Or do we want to investigate if the die is loaded ?<br />Statistics is all about answering questions when we are not sure. And shapes of distribution give a lot of information in helping us do the same.', FROM_UNIXTIME(1612224000), null, 21),
